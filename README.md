# SourcePanelMethod
A lightweight matlab implementation of the source vortex panel method to arbitrary 2D airfoils. Originally written for a class assignment, this implementation has been polished for more general usage, with arbitrary resolution. Outputs a chordwise pressure distribution across the airfoil.
